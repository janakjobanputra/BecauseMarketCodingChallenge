# Space Mine Clearing Vessel
## Because Market Coding Challenge

The original script provided to me is listed at originalScript.py.
I duplicated this file as modifiedScript.py and my most recent update is there.

Currently **modifiedScript.py satisfies all 5 test cases** provided under the examples folder.

To run modifiedScript.py, pass in the field file as the first parameter, and the script file as the second parameter (both with their relative paths from the root). Example below:

```
python modifiedScript.py examples/test1.field examples/test1.script
```

This would run the Space Mine Clearing Vessel as coded in modifiedScript.py with field from examples/test1.field file, and commands from the examples/test1.script file.
